## ⏰ 7-HOUR STUDY PLAN (TONIGHT)

### Hour 1-2: Dynamic Programming (2 hours) 🔥
**File:** 00_EXAM_PRIORITY_TOPICS.md (DP section)
**Focus:**
- 0/1 Knapsack (must know!)
- Coin Change (theory + when greedy fails)
- LCS (subsequence concept)
- LIS, LPS, Min Path Sum (quick review)

**Action:** Draw DP table for small example of each!

---

### Hour 3: Graph Algorithms (1 hour) 🗺️
**File:** 00_EXAM_PRIORITY_TOPICS.md (Graph section)
**Focus:**
- Kruskal's Algorithm (MST with Union-Find)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path, non-negative weights)

**Action:** Draw one graph example for each!

---

### Hour 4: Recursion (1 hour) 🔄
**File:** 00_EXAM_PRIORITY_TOPICS.md (Recursion section)
**Focus:**
- Fibonacci (overlapping subproblems)
- Tower of Hanoi (2^n - 1 formula)
- Factorial, GCD, LCM, Sum

**Action:** Practice writing base cases!

---

### Hour 5: Greedy + Strings (1 hour) 🎯
**File:** 00_EXAM_PRIORITY_TOPICS.md (Greedy & String sections)
**Focus:**
- Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack, Coin Change (when greedy fails!)
- Rabin-Karp (rolling hash)
- KMP (LPS array)
- Manacher's (palindrome in O(n))

**Action:** Understand when greedy works vs fails!

---

### Hour 6: Backtracking (1 hour) 🔙
**File:** 00_EXAM_PRIORITY_TOPICS.md (Backtracking section)
**Focus:**
- N-Queens (row-by-row, check diagonals)
- Graph Coloring (adjacent vertices)
- Sudoku (row, column, box)

**Action:** Understand the try-recurse-backtrack pattern!

---

### Hour 7: Revision (1 hour) 📝
**Files:** 
1. Reread 00_EXAM_PRIORITY_TOPICS.md (definitions)
2. Study LAST_MINUTE_REVISION.md
3. Review complexity table
4. Practice explaining 2-3 algorithms aloud

---

### 🛌 SLEEP (6-7 hours) - MANDATORY!
Your brain needs sleep to consolidate learning!

---

## 🌅 TOMORROW MORNING (30 min before exam)

**Read:** LAST_MINUTE_REVISION.md
**Review:** Complexity table, key definitions
**Relax:** You've studied everything!

---

## 📊 PRIORITY MATRIX

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY (Study First!)
- Dynamic Programming (6 problems)
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
- Recursion (6 problems)
- Greedy Algorithms (3 problems)
- String Algorithms (3 problems)

### ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Backtracking (3 problems)

### If Time Remains:
- Review other files for additional context

---

## 💡 STUDY TIPS

### ✅ DO THIS:
- Read slowly and understand
- Draw diagrams for visual understanding
- Practice small examples by hand
- Explain concepts aloud (teaches brain better)
- Take 5-min breaks every hour
- Stay hydrated

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- Try to memorize everything
- Skip sleep ("just one more hour...")
- Panic if something doesn't make sense
- Study new topics (stick to priority list!)
- Compare with others

---

## 🎯 EXAM WRITING STRATEGY

**For Each Question:**
1. Write definition (2-3 lines)
2. Explain purpose/real-world use (1-2 lines)
3. Show steps/algorithm (numbered list)
4. Give small example with solution
5. State time & space complexity
6. Mention key limitations/advantages

**This format works for ANY algorithm question!**

---

## 🚨 MUST REMEMBER POINTS

### Graph:
- Kruskal: Sort edges, Union-Find, O(E log E)
- Dijkstra: Non-negative weights only!, O((V+E) log V)

### Recursion:
- Always write BASE CASE first!
- Tower of Hanoi: 2^n - 1 moves

### Greedy:
- Know when it FAILS (0/1 Knapsack, arbitrary coins)
- Activity Selection: Sort by finish time

### DP:
- Overlapping subproblems + Optimal substructure
- 0/1 Knapsack: include/exclude pattern
- LCS: subsequence ≠ substring!

### Backtracking:
- Pattern: Try → Recurse → Backtrack
- N-Queens: Check diagonals!
